## Analogue Pocket export

GB Studio 1.2.2 lack of Analogue Pocket export, and some game creator can't port easily their project to the new GB Studio 3.0.

So I created this GB Studio version to provide an easy way to game creator to port their game to an Analogue Pocket made with GB Studio 1.2.2.

‚ö†Ô∏è This version is a pure hack, and is only able to export .pocket game, it breaks the ability to export ROM as a .gb game.

This version rely on a modified gbdk version. \

Also to make things clear, I'm not affiliated with `Analogue Inc` or `GB Studio`

### Porting your game

Just open your GB Studio 1.2.2 project and then "Export ROM", it should be a .pocket file.

### Testing your game

*The embedded emulator works with the pocket file*

But if you want a more accurate emulator, you can use Emulicious that is able to run pocket file. \
